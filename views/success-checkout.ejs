              <ol>
                <li>Record, or simply remember, the email you used for your subscription - this is important for the Internal bot to double check your subscription status</li>
                <li>Go to your desired Slack workspace and enter into direct messages with the Internal bot. In the instance that the bot is not yet in your workspace, <a href="/#pricing" target="_blank">click here</a> to install it via free employee install. In the instance that the bot is already installed, but you have yet to open a dialouge with it, click "Apps" at the bottom left of your Slack window and search "Internal", then "View"</li>
                <li>Once in direct messages with Internal, send the bot a message saying "New Manager". In the instance that you have yet to talk to the bot, it will ask you a few questions to get to know you better, then ask for your command again. If this happens, at the end of the introductory conversation just say "New Manager" again. If there is no introductory conversation needed, the bot will simply ask to verify the email you used for the subscription and will promptly change your status in its memory from "employee" to "manager" - providing access to managerial features</li>
                <li>Ask the bot for 'Help' and start looking through all of the potential insights!</li>

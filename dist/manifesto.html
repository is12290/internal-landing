            <div class="container" style="padding-top: 1%;">
                <h1 style="text-align: center;">Manifesto</h1>
                <p style="margin: 2%">It’s so damn hard to talk about how you’re feeling. It’s not that we’re averse to the concept, it’s that we tend to choose what is painless over what is painful - we’re on the whole hopeful that tomorrow’s version of ourself will be unaffected by the emotions previously bottled. The unfortunate reality is that the pressure of the seemingly unimportant feelings that we continuously choose to ignore build until explosion. Once we happen to explode, the all encompassing guilt rings throughout our body to the tune of “it doesn’t have to be this way. It shouldn’t be this way.” - that’s true and Internal was created to fix this. </p>
                <p style="margin: 2%">Changing the way that we talk about our feelings requires us to change the way we communicate in general. As shown in every public internet setting, the intimidation barrier for confrontation through virtual means is drastically lower than physical means, but this principle tends to only hold true for interactions with people we don’t have important relationships with. Those who have the honor of being important to us likely experience virtual emotional communication in the same way as in-person, unexpectedly.</p>
                <p style="margin: 2%">Surprise bouts of emotional frustration are the exact embodiment of the irrationality we hoped to overcome by disregarding the things that bothered us when they arose. Irrationality very rarely produces positive outcomes, meaning the thing we once tried to protect our partner from is now blasting them full-force and we’re the culprit whether we like it or not. Aggressions of this nature are the cracks in the foundation of our relationships. Habitually communicating the things that make us tick is the epoxy that mends said cracks.</p>
                <p style="margin: 2%">The truth of the matter is that habits are grueling to form, especially one as intimidating as being an open book. We try our best to be analog clocks, presenting each and every tick to the appropriate recipient until an unforeseen circumstance drains our batteries and stops our hands, but we can’t let our hands stop ticking or else we again venture toward our breaking point. The only way to ensure that the hands keep ticking is to take them out of our control, allowing an unbiased third party to be the face of our metaphorical clock.</p>
                <p style="margin: 2%">Of course this third party can’t be a human or else the entire phenomenon repeats itself, meaning the face of our clock - the thing that communicates how we’re feeling about our relationships - needs to be inanimate, non-judgemental, and trustworthy. In an ideal world, this extension of our headspace acts as both a catalyst and mediator of emotional conversations we’d otherwise shy away from.</p>
                <p style="margin: 2%">Internal, an application for bringing transparency to emotions, was created to be the third party to our headspace so that our relationships with ourselves, our partners, and our interests can reach their most peaceful and wholesome potential. There are too many important projects cut short by avoidable disagreements, families parted due to reversible resentment, and lives lost because of loneliness - Internal’s mission is to fix this. </p>
                <p style="margin: 2%">We plan to accomplish our mission by giving people a tool that initiates and mediates difficult emotional conversations for their most important relationships. By preserving relationships through enhanced emotional transparency, Internal will allow for significant positive impacts on the futures of all it’s users.</p>
                <p style="margin: 2%">World-changing products and services will enter the market because Internal prevents co-founder burnout and enhances bonds within founding teams. Marriages and families will be kept afloat due to the use of Internal as a barrier against hostility and resentment. Lives will be left untaken because Internal will call for a helping hand when users otherwise don’t believe they’re deserving of one.</p>
                <p style="margin: 2%">Help us bridge the gaps between our fellow humans and interact with Internal - we’re never in our final form.</p>

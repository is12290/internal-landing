                Internal Inc. (“<strong>Internal</strong>“) offers tools commercialized as
                    “Internal” which
                    provide the means to facilitate insights to team member emotional status, track individual emotional
                    health, and monitor employee emotional sentiment.
                    Internal understands the importance of protecting personal information. For this reason,
                    Internal strives to
                    have business procedures and security safeguards in place to protect personal information under its
                    control.

                        <strong>Application and Scope</strong>
                        This Privacy Policy (<strong>“Policy</strong>“) is intended to establish responsible and
                            transparent
                            practices for the management of personal information and to satisfy the relevant and
                            applicable legal
                            requirements. This Policy sets out the standards, responsibilities and obligations of
                            Internal in respect
                            of any personal information collected, accessed or processed by Internal in the course of
                            its business
                            operations and specifies the obligations of Internal that arise from Internal Terms of
                            Service
                            (available at <a href="https://getinternal.co/terms">https://getinternal.co/terms</a>) (the
                            “Terms”)
                            entered into between Internal and both its corporate and individual customers (each, a
                            “Customer”), whereby
                            Internal might
                            handle or have access to personal information.
                        This Policy also governs personal information collected about Internal’s website users and
                            explains how
                            Internal uses and discloses personal information collected from people who visit its
                            website and otherwise
                            interact with Internal through <a href="https://getinternal.co">https://getinternal.co</a>
                            and its
                            sister websites provided by Internal (for example, <a
                                href="https://app.getinternal.co">https://app.getinternal.co</a>)
                            (collectively, the
                            <strong>website</strong>”). It also explains how Internal uses cookies and similar
                            technologies.

                        <strong>International Compliance</strong>
                        Internal complies with: (i) data protection laws applicable to Internal; and (ii)
                            applicable industry
                            standards concerning data protection, confidentiality or information security. Internal
                            has global
                            operations and therefore, in some cases, information managed by Internal may be
                            transferred, processed and
                            stored to other countries, although at all times, Internal will ensure that personal
                            information is
                            protected by confidentiality and security procedures and protections that are, at a minimum,
                            equivalent to
                            those employed by Internal itself.
                        Internal complies with this Policy as well as applicable Canadian private sector data
                            protection laws such
                            as the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”) and
                            substantially similar
                            provincial laws pertaining to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information.
                            PIPEDA provides
                            for an adequate protection of personal information according to the European Commission
                            Decision of 20
                            December 2001 pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and the Council.
                        Internal also complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU)
                            2016/679). Where
                            applicable, our commitment to such regulation may be found in our <a

                                Customer Data submitted by Users that is in breach of this Section, and under no
                                circumstances will Internal be liable in any way for any such Customer Data.
                                Internal shall have the right, at its sole discretion, to remove any Customer Data
                                that violates the General Terms, and to reveal the identity of a User to Customer or any

                                provide the Services in accordance with the General Terms.</li>

                                and Internal (the “<strong>Service Fees</strong>”). Customer’s subscription will be

                                timely canceling its subscription in accordance with Section 8.2(i). Unless otherwise
                                agreed in writing by the Parties, the Service Fees applicable to any such renewal shall

                                Customer or the User grants Internal a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual and

                                connection with any action or litigation in any way arising out of or related to the
                                Services or the General Terms.</li>
                            <li><strong>Specific Performance</strong>. Notwithstanding any other provision in the
                                General Terms, a non-breaching Party may, upon any breach of the General Terms,
                                immediately seek enforcement of the General Terms by means of specific performance or
                                injunction, without any requirement to post a bond or other security.</li>
                            <li><strong>Force Majeure</strong>. Except as expressly provided otherwise in the General
                                Terms, Internal shall not be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the
                                performance of its obligations on account of an unforeseeable and irresistible event,
                                including external causes with the same characteristics, which may include
                                denial-of-service attacks, a failure by a third party hosting provider or utility
                                provider, strikes, shortages, riots, fires, act of God, war, terrorism and governmental
                                action.</li>
                            <li><strong>No Other Agreements</strong>. The General Terms are the complete and exclusive
                                statement of the Parties’ agreement relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes
                                all oral or written offers, understandings, representations, conditions, warranties,
                                covenants and other communications between the Parties relating hereto, including any
                                non-disclosure agreements relating to the subject matter hereof.</li>
                            <li><strong>Notices</strong>. Internal may send notices pursuant to the General Terms to
                                Customer’s email contact points provided by Customer. Customer may send notices pursuant
                                to the General Terms to Internal at <a
                                    href="mailto:support@getinternal.co">support@getinternal.co</a>. Notices shall be
                                deemed received 24 hours after they are sent.</li>
                            <li><strong>Assignment &amp; Successors</strong>. The General Terms shall be binding upon
                                and inure to the benefit of the Parties’ respective successors and assigns.</li>
                            <li><strong>Waiver</strong>. No waiver by either Party of any default in performance on the
                                part of the other Party shall constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default by
                                the defaulting Party.</li>
                            <li><strong>Severability</strong>. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Parties
                                hereby waive any provision of law that would render any clause of the General Terms
                                invalid or otherwise unenforceable in any respect. In the event that a provision of the
                                General Terms is held to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, such provision shall be
                                interpreted to fulfill its intended purpose to the maximum extent permitted by
                                applicable law, and the remaining provisions of the General Terms shall continue in full
                                force and effect.</li>
                            <li><strong>Technology Export</strong>. Customer shall not export any software provided by
                                Internal or otherwise remove it from Canada or the United States except in compliance
                                with all applicable Canadian and U.S. laws and regulations. Without limiting the
                                generality of the foregoing, Customer shall not permit any third party to access or use
                                the Website or the Internal Tool in or export such software to, a country subject
                                to an embargo by Canada or the United States.</li>
                            <li><strong>Consumer Protection Law</strong>. Internal is a workplace tool intended for
                                use by businesses and organizations and not for consumer purposes. To the maximum extent
                                permitted by law, consumer protection laws do not apply.</li>
                            <li><strong>Relationship of the Parties</strong>. The Parties are independent contractors.
                                The General Terms do not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency,
                                fiduciary or employment relationship between the Parties.</li>
                            <li><strong>Amendments</strong>. Unless Customer has a superseding written agreement with
                                Internal, Internal may amend the General Terms from time to time on its Website, as
                                its business evolves. Any revisions to the General Terms will become effective on the
                                date Internal publishes the changes. Customer and Users can review the most current
                                version of the General Terms at any time by visiting this page at <a
                                    href="https://getinternal.co/terms">https://getinternal.co/terms</a>. If
                                Customer or Users use the Services or access the Website, as the case may be, after the
                                effective date of any changes, that use or access will constitute the acceptance of the
                                revised General Terms.</li>
